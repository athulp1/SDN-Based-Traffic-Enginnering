# SDN-Based-Traffic-Enginnering

The "SDN Based Traffic Engineering" project explores the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to dynamically
manage and optimize network traffic. By simulating a network with SDN controllers and switches, the project aims
to improve network efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall performance through real-time traffic rerouting
and analysis

## Features

- **Dynamic Traffic Management**: Real-time optimization of network traffic to ensure efficient utilization and reduce congestion.
- **Centralized Control**: Unified management of network resources and policies from a centralized SDN controller.
- **Scalability**: Ability to expand and adapt the network infrastructure to meet evolving demands.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Implementation of security protocols to safeguard network data and mitigate potential threats.

# SDN-Based-Traffic-Enginnering

The "SDN Based Traffic Engineering" project explores the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to dynamically
manage and optimize network traffic. By simulating a network with SDN controllers and switches, the project aims
to improve network efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall performance through real-time traffic rerouting
and analysis

## Features

- **Dynamic Traffic Management**: Real-time optimization of network traffic to ensure efficient utilization and reduce congestion.
- **Centralized Control**: Unified management of network resources and policies from a centralized SDN controller.
- **Scalability**: Ability to expand and adapt the network infrastructure to meet evolving demands.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Implementation of security protocols to safeguard network data and mitigate potential threats.

## Project Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the SDN-based traffic management system:

### Explanation

1. **SDN Controller**: The central component that manages the entire network infrastructure. It monitors the network, collects data, and makes decisions to optimize traffic flow.
2. **Network Infrastructure**: The physical or virtual network devices managed by the SDN controller.
3. **Host Machine**: The machine that hosts the SDN controller and the network emulation environment.
4. **Mininet Network Emulator**: An emulator that creates a virtual network environment for testing and development purposes.
5. **Iperf Traffic Generator**: A tool used to generate network traffic for performance testing and evaluation.
6. **Wireshark Network Analyzer**: A tool used to capture and analyze network traffic, helping in troubleshooting and performance analysis.

In this setup:
- The SDN controller manages the network infrastructure and interacts with the host machine.
- The host machine runs the Mininet network emulator, which emulates the network environment.
- The Iperf traffic generator creates traffic within the Mininet emulated network.
- Wireshark captures and analyzes the traffic generated by Iperf, providing insights into network performance and issues.
